# Proxy Contract

## Overview

This Solidity smart contract implements a proxy pattern, allowing it to delegate function calls to another contract. The proxy contract serves as an intermediary between users and the implementation contract. This pattern enables upgradability of the underlying logic while preserving the contract's address and state.

## Contract Details

- **Solidity Version**: ^0.8.0


## Contract Structure

The contract consists of the following components:

1. **Admin**: The `admin` variable stores the address of the contract administrator, who has the authority to update the implementation contract.

2. **Implementation**: The `implementation` variable holds the address of the contract that contains the actual implementation of the logic.

3. **Constructor**: The constructor initializes the `admin` variable with the address of the deploying account.

4. **Update Function**: The `update` function allows the administrator to update the implementation contract by providing a new address.

5. **Fallback Function**: The fallback function is triggered when a function is called on the proxy contract that does not exist. It delegates the function call to the implementation contract using delegatecall and forwards any incoming Ether.

## Usage

To deploy and use this contract, follow these steps:

1. Deploy the Proxy contract to the Ethereum blockchain.

2. Set the initial implementation contract address using the constructor.

3. Interact with the proxy contract as if it were the implementation contract itself. All function calls and Ether transfers will be forwarded to the implementation contract.

4. If an upgrade to the contract's logic is required, call the `update` function with the address of the new implementation contract.

## Important Notes

- Ensure that only the administrator has access to the `update` function to prevent unauthorized changes to the implementation contract.

- Exercise caution when updating the implementation contract to avoid disrupting the functionality of the proxy contract and any associated systems or applications.

- Consider adding additional access control mechanisms or implementing a multi-signature scheme for contract upgrades to enhance security and decentralization.
